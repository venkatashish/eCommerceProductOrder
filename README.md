Scenario 2: E-commerce Product Management

Use Case: Manage products and customer orders for an online store.

Classes:
  
  Product: Represents an individual product with attributes like name, price, and stock quantity.
  
  Order: Represents a customer order that includes a list of products and order total.

Constructor:
  
  Product: Define a constructor that initializes the name, price, and stock quantity.
  
  Order: Initialize an empty list of products in the order.

Access Modifiers:
  
  Use private for the product’s attributes.
  
  Use public methods for adding products to the order and for calculating the total price.

Tasks:
  
  Add validation to the Order class so that a product’s stock quantity is checked before it’s added to an order.
  
  Add methods to get details of the product and order (use public getters).
